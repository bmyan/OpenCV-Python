# Object Detection using Feature Matching

This project is built with code snippets from the OpenCV website. Implemented a known object detector using feature mapping and homography. SIFT is used for feature detection and ratio test is applied for finding the best matches. RANSAC algorithm is used for parameter estimation.

The image of a pepsi can has been used for the image to search in the larger image.

This is the image in which the query image will be searched for to find a match.

After the program is executed, the final output image is as follows.
